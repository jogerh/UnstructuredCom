note right
    RunUpdateLoop repeatedly calls Frame::GetId(). 
    An infinite loop is used to increase probability
    of reproducing the issue, but is not required.

== Releasing player by clicking in Client window == 

User -> Client: Click in window
activate Client

Client -> Player: Release
deactivate Client

loop Infinite
    Player -> Frame: GetId
    activate Player
        activate Frame
            Frame -> Player: FinalRelease
            note right
                The Player::FinalRelease call is unexpectedly 
                processed while the player is calling GetId 
                on the Frame object.  
            end note
            activate Player
            Player -> Frame: FinalRelease

        Player -> FrameSource: FinalRelease
        Frame --> Player 

    deactivate Player 
    destroy FrameSource
    destroy Player

    Player [#FF0000]-> Player: <color:red>Crash</color>
    note right
        Although Player object was destroyed, 
        the loop can not be stopped, and continue 
        running on garbage data. (The entire 
        Player object is destroyed).
